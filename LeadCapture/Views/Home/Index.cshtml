                    <h3>Valuation of your New Home</h3>
                    <p>
                        When arranging a mortgage, after the initial assessment of the application, all lenders will want a valuation carried out by an independent surveyor on the property you are buying which unfortunately is usually at your costs. The lender will only want a “basic” valuation carried out, which is really only for their purposes and will not provide you with any report.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        As purchasing a property for the first time is a big step for most people, both financially and emotionally, you may want a more comprehensive survey to be carried out, one which will provide you with a more in depth view of the property, potentially highlighting any work that may be required to be carried out on the property in the near future.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        There are three main types of valuations/surveys and each comes with a different cost, these can vary considerably from lender to lender but below we have provided a guide of the likely costs based on a property of £150,000
